## Course Description

After the course, the student should understand the fundamentals of a projective rendering pipeline (such as OpenGL) sufficiently well to implement all of its primary components. In addition to this broad foundation, the student should have achieved additional depth of expertise in a relevant graphics topic of their choice.  

This course provides a solid foundation in graphics programming at the implementation level. This is achieved by having the student implement the major components of a traditional projective rendering pipeline in C/C++, such as: 
- modeling and viewing transformations 
- perspective projection 
- clipping and back-face culling 
- scan conversion 
- z-buffering 
- per-face and per-vertex shading 
- texture mapping and bump mapping 

In addition, the student will be supervised in the acquisition of specialized knowledge in the graphics-programming area of their choosing. Example topics might include: 
- ray tracing 
- parameterized surfaces 
- physical simulation 
- particle systems  Help
