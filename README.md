# Graphics-Programming Spring 2015 at IT-University of Copenhagen

Final project for the graphics programming course at the ITU. It is a raytracer, coded in C++, with a C# frontend for showing the resulting image. Every scene is hard coded in the engine and so it is not suitable for use in the real world, but is merely a study of coding a ray tracer in C++.

## Disclaimer

This project had a one month deadline and didn't have any requirements for performance or memory management, so it has neither.

## Course Description

After the course, the student should understand the fundamentals of a projective rendering pipeline (such as OpenGL) sufficiently well to implement all of its primary components. In addition to this broad foundation, the student should have achieved additional depth of expertise in a relevant graphics topic of their choice.  

This course provides a solid foundation in graphics programming at the implementation level. This is achieved by having the student implement the major components of a traditional projective rendering pipeline in C/C++, such as: 
- modeling and viewing transformations 
- perspective projection 
- clipping and back-face culling 
- scan conversion 
- z-buffering 
- per-face and per-vertex shading 
- texture mapping and bump mapping 

In addition, the student will be supervised in the acquisition of specialized knowledge in the graphics-programming area of their choosing. Example topics might include: 
- ray tracing 
- parameterized surfaces 
- physical simulation 
- particle systems  Help
