\section{Conclusion}
Ray tracing is a powerful rendering technique, that shines in a fast, object-oriented language like C++. We successfully created a system, which is easy to extend and maintain, and the system produces good looking renderings with a decent amount of features. We successfully implemented, various ray-object intersection, shaders, lights, shadows, reflections and refractions, while features such as .obj import, meshes, textures and GPU-parallelization unfortunately went short. Some of the features such as soft shadow is poorly optimised and could be improved with a better algorithm, and other optimization techniques, such as Kd-trees, could also be implemented to improve the processing time.\\

Overall we are satisfied with the result and believe that given more time we would easily be able to implement the last features or optimizations, while GPU-parallelization might be a bit further down the road.
