# Ray-tracing (briefly) explained

Ray-tracing is a technique used in computer graphics to produce renditions of scenes. The technique goes a long way in mimicking real-world physics behaviour, in particular light. 

There are three main-components, that needs to be considered, and that each have their effect on the final outcome (rendition).
1. The camera-position
2. The viewport's dimensions and location (relative to the camera)
3. The scene, containing objects that may or may not be transparent.
